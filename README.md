# Cisco CP-3905 Configurator
This is a simple project to create a Cisco CP-3905 simple and efficient configurator.
**Please note that this is a WIP. We're still in early stages of development and its core features are still being created.**

## Why

Setup a Cisco CP-3905 is a little hell experience. You need to choose between an outdated or a ads-based TFTP server, get the Cisco latest updates for your phone, config a giant XML file, config the phone, and start the server. Then you have to open ports, open Windows firewall.. And when you check it out, two hours of your precious life were thrown away. And your phone is still not working.

## How
With this app, you will be able to edit lots of phones in just one interface. You can create config templates and use them to add new phones. You can choose specific options to be edited using the Easy Mode. When you finish it all, run the Transmitter, choose what files are going to be delivered, config your phone to read from the designed IP and you're good to go.

## Locales
This app is going to be available in English and Brazilian Portuguese.
